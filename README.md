# Password-Generator

About The Project

[Password Generator Screenshot](./PasswordGenerator.png)

    For this project, the goal was to create a secure password based on the
specifications the user decides.

    This password needed to be a minimum of 8 characters and a maximum of 128 characters
with the option for the user to add numeric or special characters. The password also should also let the user choose between uppercase or lowercase letters.

    Once the user decides the specifics of the password, it will generate and provide the
new password on screen for the user to copy for use. The user is able to click on the generate password button again to start the process over.
